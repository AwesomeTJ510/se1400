            <p>After playing <a href="https://neal.fun" target="_blank">Neal.fun</a> for a while, I have came up with a list of pros and cons on the website. These are all in context to if Neal.fun was made for the exact same reason I'm making my website, which, obviously, it's not.</p>
        
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It had a simplistic design</li>
                <li>It had engaging simple games</li>
                <li>it was very entertaining for hours</li>
                <li>It had a ton of games, so if you got bored you could change</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>cons</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The games were too distracting</li>
                <li>They were too much like games instead of fidget toys</li>
            </ol>
